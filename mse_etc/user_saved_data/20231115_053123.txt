======================================================
The calculation Signal-to-Noise vs. Magnitude

Resolution Mode   = Moderate Resolution
Airmass           = 1.0
PWV [mm]          = 1.0
Exposure Time [s] = 1200
Exposure Number   = 3
Magnitude Range [mag] : 18.00 - 26.00

Band	 Sky
[Blue]	 20.70
[Green]	 20.70
[Red]	 20.70
